# Q-19

## What is the rule set?

### Ans

```
header > .btns .get-std-free {
 color: #794cff;
  background-color: #ece5ff;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

- hear .btns class is selected by child selector first.
- then .get-std-free class is selected by descendant selector.
- then the properties are given in curly braces.
- in curly braces at left side there is property name and at right side there is value of property.
- Ex: in first line `color` is property and `#794cff` is value of property.
