# Q-10

## Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

### Ans

- Background is shorthand property, and it is use for background-img,-attachment,-position, bg-color,linear gradient,radial gradient etc, Then color is use for content color.
<br>
- there for, background property is for styling of background when color property used for styling of content.
<br>
- So color is different from background. there fore both are separate properties.
