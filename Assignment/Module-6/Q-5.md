# Q-5

## What are undeclared and undefined variables?

### Ans:

1. undeclared variables
   - This type of variable is not created in any function or body.
   - Ex. if we not create any variable and we print `console.log(a);` so it says `"a is not defined"`.
2. undefined variables
   - It type variable is created but it has not value assigned.
   - Ex. if we just create variable `(b)` and we print `let b; console.log(b);` so it's give output in consol is `"undefined"`.

- **Example:**

```javascript
console.log(a);
let b;
console.log(b);
```
