## What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

### Ans:

- Here is the difference between ViewState and SessionState.

1.  **ViewState:**

- ViewState is used to preserve the state of a web page across postbacks. It retains the values of controls between postbacks to the same page.
- ViewState data is stored in a hidden field on the page itself, specifically within the \_\_VIEWSTATE hidden form field. This data is sent to the client and returned to the server with each postback.
- The data stored in ViewState is page-specific. It is available only for the current page and cannot be accessed on other pages.
- ViewState data is Base64-encoded, but it is not encrypted by default, which makes it susceptible to being viewed if intercepted. However, it can be encrypted for added security using the ViewStateEncryptionMode property.
- Since ViewState data is included in the page's HTML and sent back and forth between the client and server with each request and response, it can increase the page size and affect performance, especially with large amounts of data.
- ViewState is suitable for preserving control values and user input within a single page during postbacks (e.g., maintaining the state of form inputs).

2.  **SessionState:**

- SessionState is used to preserve user data across multiple requests and pages within a web session. It maintains user-specific data for the duration of the user's session.
- SessionState data is stored on the server. The actual storage can be in memory (in-process), a state server (out-of-process), or a SQL Server database, depending on the session state mode configured in the application.
- SessionState data is available across all pages and requests for a specific user session. It persists for the duration of the session, which typically ends after a period of inactivity or when the user explicitly logs out.
- Since SessionState data is stored on the server, it is more secure compared to ViewState. Sensitive data can be stored without the risk of exposure during client-server communication.
- SessionState does not directly affect the size of the page sent to the client, but it does consume server resources. In-process session state is faster but consumes more memory, while out-of-process options (state server, SQL Server) can handle larger loads but may have higher latency.
- SessionState is ideal for storing user-specific information that needs to persist across multiple pages and requests, such as user authentication details, shopping cart contents, and user preferences.
