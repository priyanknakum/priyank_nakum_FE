## What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

### Ans.

- ` <br>` tag is used to separate line. it is self-closing tag.
- ` <p> content </p>` tag is used to separate paragraph. It is pair tag.
- And using other block element like (div,section,p,li etc.) we can separate sections of text.
